[#](#) Runac 
# Known Features:
- Fennec Fox
- Electric Blue and black fur.
    - Notable markings include an inverted heart on ver chest
- Glowing lines/"Runes"
- Many tails
    - At least 7 tails have been counted, possibly more?
    - Blue in color
    - At least 4' long each
- Has been seen with multiple genitalia at different points; 
    - Penis has been seen most commonly in historic photos
        - Usually below 5" when flaccid, almost always hidden inside a sheath
    - 'Panties' have been seen more commonly in modern photos
        - Can not assume this means the subject has a vagina or no genitalia
    - Vagina has also been identified in some photographs
    - A lack of any genitalia has also been noted in some cases
    - In addition, penis and vagina have also been identified coexisting as
      well
- Bar piercings on ver nipples, which has been shown to conduct energy out of the subject.

# Past/Disputed Features:
- Same as present; but with a 'creature' for a tail.
    - This creature was approximately 7' long, quite fluffy; and was colored with the same fur as the subject.
    - Instead of eyes and a nose, it had glowing blue markings in the same shape as eyes and a nose. But the eyes still changed shape and seemed to 'emote' the same way a sapient creature would.
    - The creature seems to have a separate mouth. It is unknown to what degree the creature shared a digestive system with the subject; or if it had a separate digestive tract.
    - The creature also had ears, shaped much akin to the subject; and emoted in much the same way.
    - Unknown if it had separate intelligence, or merely unconsciously controlled by subject
    - Unknown if the 7 tails are merely a different form of this "intelligence" or an effect of shape shifting.
- Centaur; this version of the creature has four limbs. A torso that is very much similar to ver current form; however from the waist down there is a much more quadrupedal form. Much akin to feral foxes. This version was frequently seen with a large and exposed penis; as well as having a 'creature' tail.

# Theories:
- Subject is likely has some shape shifting ability, due to major changes to ver physiology 
- Many major features have been noted to exist and stay unchanging for long periods of time
- The subject has also rarely ever been seen doing large and dramatic changes over a short period of time
- This leads us to believe that the subject can not shape shift at will; and must either only change via a mechanism that is not easy to utilize.
    - Other theories posit that the subject can only change between clones.

- The subject seems to maintain memories and personality between clones
- Perhaps the consciousness of the subject exists separate of the clones?
- Or maybe there is a hive-mind between them?
- If so, perhaps the consciousness/hive-mind could possibly be the mechanism that alters the forms of new clones?

- Subject seems to exhibit bioluminescence, but this bioluminescence has no obvious purpose.
- Looking at nature, bioluminescence is used to attract either mates or prey.
- However, the subject is frequently prey verself; which discredits the predator theory.
- The mate theory seems plausible, as the subject does seem to easily attract mates. However, the nature of the attraction very rarely seems to be born from physical traits; and instead a psychological connection through social connections and sexual attraction. Must research further.
- Another possible theory is that the glowing is not bioluminescence, but instead a form of magic. Mates of the subject, after unique forms of 'bonding' have found themselves capable of limited forms of bioluminescence. It is currently unknown in nature to develop bioluminescence well into adulthood, and is likely caused by an entirely separate mechanism.

- Possible theories for the 'creature tail'; it is a parasitic entity that latched onto the subject. It's discontinued existence could be due to removal (or as some of the more superstitious members of the lab call it, an 'exorcism').
    - Likely explanation is tied into the 'shape shifting' theory. The subject no longer wished for a tail and decided to create a form that has the now iconic 7 extremely fluffy tails.

# Likes/Dislikes
- Howling/talking/'auuuu'-ing
- Being eaten
    - The subject has a bizarre attraction to the idea of being 'vored', a term referring to eating adult sapient creatures. While often seen for sexual gratification, the 'reproductive' utility of such an act is incredibly limited. Instead it has been assumed that it fulfils a different kind of need on Maslow's hierarchy; but there is no consensus as to which.
    - The creature seems to be incredibly submissive in the face of voraphilic predators. Which indicates a kind of Freudian 'death drive', however there is much debate around the labs as to whether this is a suitable term; due to the subject's ability to be 'revived' via cloning.
- Eating
    - It has only been confirmed that the subject eats other adult sapient creatures. As to whether the subject eats a more typical diet for Fennecs is entirely unknown. More research should be conducted.
- Being bitten, the subject seems to be aroused by being bitten
- Fangs, the subject seems to be aroused by the sight of sharp fangs

# Voraphilic traits
- As the subject is quite well known for partaking in voraphilic activities, this part of the document will be dedicated to detailing anything known about ver activities and traits involving eating.
- Subject has been the 'prey' in; oral vore, anal vore, breast vore, cleavage vore, cock vore, 'unbirth', and 'soul vore'.
    - The atheist members of staff insist on a differing name for 'soul vore', insisting that the soul does not exist; but rather it is a physical aspect of the body being referred to. However this name will still be used, as it is what the subject has named this phenomenon.
- Subject has been the predator of; oral vore, anal vore, breast vore, cock vore, unbirthing, 'soul vore', and 'object vore'.
    - It is unknown how 'object vore' differs from Pica, the eating disorder involving the swallowing of non-nutritive objects.  Interviews with the subject involve ver saying that vi 'really loves' this act; the only recorded act was a clear ruse to trick prey into cock vore.
- The subject has been involved in many acts of vore; but a surprising detail is the variety involved. One expert in the subject expressed surprise at audio/visual records and reports of voraphilic events.  Detailing that the subject is frequently involved in both 'hard' and 'soft' acts of vore. 
    - Soft vore is typically very non-violent forms of vore. Predators typically keep prey alive for as long as possible, and usually don't dismember or even harm prey beyond superficial wounds and damage.  Sometimes it is enjoyed recreationally and non-fatally, with prey escaping afterwards; typically this form is a subset of BDSM culture rather than done for nutritional purposes.
    - Hard vore is reminicent of what one encounters with feral predators, prey is dismembered and fatally eaten. While very frequently done for nutrition, there is a sizable and passionate fandom for this kind of vore; typically with extremely sexual overtones. 
- Predators who have eaten the subject describes ver as 'grape' or 'tart apple', and frequently utter surprise that vi doesn't taste like 'blue raspberry'. These flavours have also been documented to occur in the milk, cum, and saliva of predators (though typically only associated with areas that the subject has come in contact with).
- Despite the frequent 'fatal' outcomes of voraphilic events involving the subject as prey, vi often 'survives' through cloning. Although the mechanics as to how this cloning works, an entire cottage industry has popped up around the subject. The largest of which is 'Ruru's Delivery Service', which caters to voraphilic customers who "order" new Runacs after fatal voraphilic events.
